# Checkout Android [UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

This is an android app that allows you to manage an inventory of items that can be checked in/out.

## What does this app do?
Users can automatically check in and out items by scanning its barcode. 
They can also add new items to the inventory by scanning its barcode and logging its other information.

## Technologies & libraries used:

### Backend
As a beginner to backend development, I used this project to explore building an API, and other new areas 
without making things far too complicated. Unfortunately, it is not as sophisticated as I hoped but it 
gets the job done and follows the ideal practices.

<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>RSpec</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Heroku</li>
</ul>

### Android
<ul>
<li>Retrofit</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
<li>Kotlin</li>
</ul>

### TBD/Nice to have
- [ ] use Room for database
- [ ] use MVVM & Dagger/Toothpick
- [ ] expand on the rails app; make a page that allows you to view and edit inventory (add/delete items)
- [ ] add image to item resource
